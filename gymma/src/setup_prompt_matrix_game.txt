This task is a two-player cooperative matrix game with a given 3×3 matrix:
[[11, -30, 0], [-30, 7, 0], [0, 6, 5]]
The environment consists of two agents, agent_0 and agent_1, each having three possible actions(0,1,2) corresponding to the row and column indices of the matrix.
Once both agents select their actions, they receive a shared reward determined by the corresponding entry in the matrix.
There is no communication between the two agents, and the objective is to maximize the shared reward.
Be sure to prevent the strategy from falling into a local optimum, and only get the highest reward if both intelligences choose action 0.
The state vector is 2 dims, storing the actions that the two agents have just executed.
At the first step at the beginning of an episode, the state vector is [-1,-1], because the agents have not yet started executing actions.
Please take care to handle this special case.

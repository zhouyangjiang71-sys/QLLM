The Level-Based Foraging environment focus on the coordination of involved agents.
The task for each agent is to navigate the grid-world map and collect items.
Each agent and food item is assigned a level and food items are randomly scattered in the environment.
In order to collect a food item, agents have to choose a pick-up action next to the food item.
However, such collection is only successful if 2 agents participate in the pickup at the same time.
At the same time the agents involved in the pickup must be one square above, below, left and right of the food item.
Agents receive team reward equal to the level of the collected food item.
In each step, every agent can choose to act by moving in one of four directions or attempt to pick up a food item.
The task is an 8*8 grid-world with 2 agents and 2 food items scattered in the grid.
Below, we will provide additional details to global states, actions and rewards for the Level-Based Foraging environment.
States:
Global state vector consists of 3 component(agents component,food items component and last step action)(Total dimension: 2x3+2x3+2=14 dims)
1.Agents Component (2 agents × 3 features = 6 dims)
Feature 0: agent_i's x coordinate (i=0,1)
Feature 1: agent_i's y coordinate
Feature 2: agent_i's level
2.Food Items Component (2 Food Items × 3 features = 6 dims)
Feature 0: food_item_i's x coordinate
Feature 1: food_item_i's y coordinate
Feature 2: food_item_i's level
When a food item has been picked up, then the respective values are replaced with (-1, -1, 0).You have to be careful to handle this particular situation properly.
3.The actions just executed by the agents. (2 dims)
{0,1,2...5} respectively represent {Noop, Move North, Move South, Move West, Move East, Pickup}
This information is set to [-1 -1] when the environment is in the first step of each episode.
Actions:
In Level-Based Foraging environments, each agent has six possible discrete actions to choose at each timestep:
Ai = {Noop, Move North, Move South, Move West, Move East, Pickup}
While the first action corresponds to the action simply staying within its grid and the last action being used to pickup nearby food,
the remaining four actions encode discrete 2D navigation.
Upon choosing these actions, the agent moves a single cell in the chosen direction within the grid.
Picking up is only valid if the sum of the levels of the agents doing the picking up action is greater than or equal to the level of the food.
At the same time, the agents involved in the pickup must be positioned one cell above, below, to the left, or to the right of the food.
Reward:
Agents only receive non-zero team reward for picking up food items within the Level-Based Foraging environment.
The reward for picking up a food item equals to the food level.

We are playing Cooperative Navigation. In this task, 6 agents are asked to reach 6 landmarks.
Each agent should move to get close to one landmark and avoid collision(distance<=0.3) with other agents.
The agent-team are rewarded based on how far the closest agent is to each landmark (the reward equals the negative value of the sum of the minimum distances).
At the same time, the agent-team are penalized if they collide each other (-1 for each collision).
At each step, each agent receives an observation array.
This observation is represented by an array with 36 dimensions:
concat([agent's velocity, agent's location, 6 landmarks' relative locations, 5 other agents' relative locations, communication code]).
The agent's velocity is 2-dimensional, including x and y components.
The agent's location is 2-dimensional, including x and y coordinates.
The landmarks' relative locations are 6x2 dimensions, including relative x and y coordinates(landmark_i.x-agent.x, landmark_i.y-agent.y).
The other agents' relative locations are 5x2 dimensions, including relative x and y coordinates(agent_i.x-agent.x, agent_i.y-agent.y).
The communication code are 10 dimensions, they have no role in credit assignment.
The global state space is concatenate together from the observation space of the three agents, which are 36x6 dimensions.
Agent action space: [no_action, move_left, move_right, move_down, move_up]
